# Logistic_Regression_Learning_Project
Project is based on the Logistic Regression Project from ‘Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp’ by Jose Portilla. 
Course is available on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/)

Differences with respect to the original project.
* Use of pipeline and feature scaling from sklearn
* Additional feature for the Logistic Regression model based on the:
    * country,
    * city (ToDo),
    * timestamp data (ToDo)
* ToDo: Find another dataset big enough that it will also enable train/test/validation split
